Pik-Pok Social Network started as an educational project. The main idea was to demonstrate how one can build a large scalable social network mostly with php and javascript. Pik Pok is a social media platform for creating, sharing and discovering photos, think Tik-Tok but for photos. The app can be used by people as an outlet to express themselves and their stories through their photos and albums.

## Download and Installation

You can download the files from https://github.com/NasosG/pik_pok. 
<br>We used xampp locally, so we installed it under xampp/htdocs folder and we made a mysql database(we named the database pik_pok).
All the tables of the database are in pik_pok.sql folder

1. Open PHPMyAdmin, create a Database & import `pik_pok.sql`. 
2. Open `db/db.php` & fill up your host, username, password and database name 
for example our variables are $dbhost = "localhost", $dbuser = "root", $dbpass = "", $db = "pik_pok";
3. Enjoy!!

## Requirements

1. Latest version of PHP.
